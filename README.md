# 💻 My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal website where I showcase my work and skills.

## 🛠️ How I built this:
* **Base Template:** I used the **Craftivo Bootstrap template** as a starting point for the design.
* **Customization:** I modified the HTML and CSS to add my own content, projects, and personal touch.
* **Backend:** I integrated **Firebase** to make the contact form functional and save messages.
* **Deployment:** Hosted on GitHub Pages.
